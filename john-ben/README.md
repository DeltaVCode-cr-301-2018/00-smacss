##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(For the base, if there were no classes or IDs attached to the tag, that's where we figured they went. For the layout, if anything had an ID, we presumed that it went into the layout page. Finally, for the module, we figured that anything that had a class attached to it was apart of the module page.)

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(No, we didn't because we weren't really focused on working with the css. We could go back later and add more css if need be.)
